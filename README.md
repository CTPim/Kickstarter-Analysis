# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the first analysis is to find if there are any correlations between theatre launch dates and the number of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes. The purpose of the second analysis is to find if there any correlations between the success rate of plays and their minimal funding goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

  A difficulty one might face when analysing a data set such as this is where to begin. After gathering all your data, one might find it difficult to ask the correct questions and gather meaningful conclusions. A challenge I faced was using Excel functions and algorithms in order to correctly analyze the data. Knowing which functions to perform and how to organize them in a spreadsheet is something I need practice in. I performed my analysis by using Excel to create pivot tables and graphs to display my findings. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  
  Based on this data, it can be concluded that theatre productions have the largest number of successful outcomes when launched in the month of May. It can also be concluded that theatre productions have the smallest number of successful outcomes when launched in December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  From interpretting the data from the Outcomes based on Goals, it can be concluded that as the funding goal for plays increases, the failure rate also increases. The funding goal is directly proportional to the failure rate.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  A limitation of this dataset would be that it does not incorporate other variables that may affect the success rate of the kickstarters. There may be other factors and data that have not been gathered or the dataset has been gathered from a unreliable source. Since the dataset is so large, there may be mistakes in the data that can causse untrue outcomes. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  Another possible graph that can be used to interpret this data would be the clustered bar graph or the stacked bar graph. These graphs may be more visually pleaseing and easier to understand. Rather than use lines and numbers, the size of the columns in the bar graph can quickly tell us the conclusions from the data.
